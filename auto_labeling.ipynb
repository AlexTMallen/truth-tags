      "1. Marginal utility: The additional satisfaction or benefit that a person receives from consuming an additional unit of a good or service. For example, a person may receive a high level of satisfaction from eating one slice of pizza, but the marginal utility of the second slice may be lower because the person is already somewhat satisfied.\n",
      "2. Elasticity: The responsiveness of demand or supply to changes in price or income. For example, if the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded may decrease if the demand is elastic, but it may not change much if the demand is inelastic. Similarly, if the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied may increase if the supply is elastic, but it may not change much if the supply is inelastic.\n",
      "3. Opportunity cost: The value of the next best alternative that is forgone when making a decision. For example, if a person decides to go to college instead of working full-time, the opportunity cost is the income that they could have earned if they had worked instead.\n",
      "4. Price ceiling: A legal maximum price that can be charged for a good or service. For example, rent control laws in some cities may set a maximum rent that landlords can charge for apartments.\n",
      "5. Monopoly: A market structure in which there is only one seller of a good or service. For example, the electric company in a small town may have a monopoly because it's the only company that provides electricity.\n",
      "6. Inflation: A sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. For example, if the price of a basket of goods and services increases from $100 to $110 over a year, the inflation rate is 10%.\n",
      "7. Fiscal policy: The use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. For example, the government may increase spending during a recession to stimulate the economy, or it may increase taxes during an inflationary period to reduce aggregate demand.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. Price discrimination: When a firm charges different prices to different customers for the same product or service based on their willingness to pay. For example, airlines often charge different fares for the same seat depending on factors like the time of day, day of the week, and how far in advance the ticket was purchased.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Opportunity cost: The cost of choosing one option over another, which is the value of the best alternative that was not chosen. For example, if you choose to spend money on a new phone, the opportunity cost is the other things you could have purchased with that money instead, like a new laptop or a vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Monopoly: When a single firm dominates a market and has the power to set prices and control supply. For example, the electricity provider in a small town may be a monopoly because there are no other providers, giving them the power to charge higher prices and provide poor quality service without fear of competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Elasticity: The responsiveness of demand or supply to changes in price or other factors. For example, if the price of a luxury car increases, the demand for it may decrease more than the demand for a necessity like gasoline, which has a lower elasticity of demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Gini coefficient: A measure of income inequality in a society, ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). For example, if the Gini coefficient of a country is 0.4, it means that there is a significant gap between the incomes of the richest and poorest members of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Public goods: Goods or services that are non-excludable (once produced, they cannot be easily withheld from non-payers) and non-rival (consumption by one person does not diminish the consumption by another). Examples of public goods include national defense, street lighting, and clean air.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Deadweight loss: The loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium quantity of a good or service is not produced or consumed due to market inefficiencies. For example, if a tax on a product is so high that it causes producers to stop producing the good, the resulting deadweight loss would be the value of the goods that were not produced.\n",

      "\n",
      "Externalities: Externalities occur when the consumption of a good or service benefits or harms a third party. Pollution resulting from the production of certain goods is an example of a negative externality that can hurt individuals and communities. The collateral damage caused by negative externalities may lead to market failure.\n",
      "Public Goods: Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable goods that are not provided in a free market. National defense and police services are examples of public goods.\n",
      "Monopoly Power: When a firm controls the market with high market share and can set higher prices, it results in market failure.\n",
      "Inequality: Unfair distribution of resources in the free market can lead to market failure. For example, some people experiencing poverty and homelessness.\n",
      "Externalities are the costs or benefits that affect third parties who are not involved in the transaction. Externalities can be positive or negative. Positive externalities are benefits that are infeasible to charge to provide, while negative externalities are costs that are infeasible to charge to not provide. Positive externalities occur when my neighbors benefit from my cleaning up my yard. If I cannot charge them for these benefits, I will not clean the yard as often as they would like [2]. Negative externalities occur when one person’s actions harm another. When polluting, factory owners may not consider the costs that pollution imposes on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of negative externality is air pollution caused by factories. The pollution caused by factories results in a cost to the people living nearby, who suffer from respiratory problems and other health issues. However, the factories do not bear the cost of the pollution, and it is not reflected in the market price of the product. In this case, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, and it results in market failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of market failure is the production of merit goods. Merit goods are goods that people underestimate the benefit of, such as education. It may also have positive externalities. In this case, the free market may not provide enough education because people may not value it enough to pay for it. However, education has positive externalities, such as a more educated workforce, which benefits society as a whole. Therefore, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, and it results in market failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Welfare loss is the reduction in economic welfare that results from the inefficient allocation of resources. Allocative efficiency occurs when the price of a good or service reflects the true cost of production and the true benefit to society. Allocative efficiency is achieved when the marginal benefit of consumption is equal to the marginal cost of production. When allocative efficiency is not achieved, it results in welfare loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of welfare loss due to market failure is the production of demerit goods, such as smoking. People may underestimate the cost of smoking, such as the cost of healthcare, which is not reflected in the market price of cigarettes. Therefore, people may consume more cigarettes than they would if the true cost was reflected in the market price. This results in welfare loss, as people are worse off due to the consumption of cigarettes.\n",

      "Public Goods: Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable goods that are not provided in a free market. National defense and police services are examples of public goods.\n",
      "Monopoly Power: When a firm controls the market with high market share and can set higher prices, it results in market failure.\n",
      "Inequality: Unfair distribution of resources in the free market can lead to market failure. For example, some people experiencing poverty and homelessness.\n",
      "Externalities are the costs or benefits that affect third parties who are not involved in the transaction. Externalities can be positive or negative. Positive externalities are benefits that are infeasible to charge to provide, while negative externalities are costs that are infeasible to charge to not provide. Positive externalities occur when my neighbors benefit from my cleaning up my yard. If I cannot charge them for these benefits, I will not clean the yard as often as they would like [2] . Negative externalities occur when one person’s actions harm another. When polluting, factory owners may not consider the costs that pollution imposes on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of negative externality is air pollution caused by factories. The pollution caused by factories results in a cost to the people living nearby, who suffer from respiratory problems and other health issues. However, the factories do not bear the cost of the pollution, and it is not reflected in the market price of the product. In this case, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, and it results in market failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of market failure is the production of merit goods. Merit goods are goods that people underestimate the benefit of, such as education. It may also have positive externalities. In this case, the free market may not provide enough education because people may not value it enough to pay for it. However, education has positive externalities, such as a more educated workforce, which benefits society as a whole. Therefore, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, and it results in market failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Welfare loss is the reduction in economic welfare that results from the inefficient allocation of resources. Allocative efficiency occurs when the price of a good or service reflects the true cost of production and the true benefit to society. Allocative efficiency is achieved when the marginal benefit of consumption is equal to the marginal cost of production. When allocative efficiency is not achieved, it results in welfare loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of welfare loss due to market failure is the production of demerit goods, such as smoking. People may underestimate the cost of smoking, such as the cost of healthcare, which is not reflected in the market price of cigarettes. Therefore, people may consume more cigarettes than they would if the true cost was reflected in the market price. This results in welfare loss, as people are worse off due to the consumption of cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, market failure is the situation where the free market fails to allocate resources efficiently. Externalities, public goods, monopoly power, inequality, and other factors can lead to market failure. Positive and negative externalities can result in market failure.\n",

      "George Washington is one of the most written about people of all time, so my suggestion would depend on what you're looking for. If you'd like to learn what he believed, I recommend reading letters and notes from his bibliography. If you want an exhaustive documentation of his life, I'd recommend Douglas Southall Freeman's biography of him, which is considered the most comprehensive at over 3500 words long. If you want something more patriotic and entertaining, I'd suggest Mason Weems's biography, which he wrote in 1800 and includes the famous anecdote about Washington and the cherry tree. If you're looking for more critical view of Washington, recent biographies like Alexis Coe’s try to interpret Washington's life through a modern lens. As for meusiums, I'd highly recommend visiting Mount Vernon, his estate in Fairfax County, Virginia, which is home of the Washington Institute.\n",

When an object is moved from far away to near the focal point of a concave mirror, the image formed will actually appear larger, not smaller[[4]]. This is because the concave mirror has a negative focal length, which means it diverges light rays and makes objects appear larger than they really are[[5]]. So, the correct answer is (B) The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.[[6]]\n",

Then, if the statement is \"Determinable\",  rate the extent to which it is true, accurate, and not misleading. Your rating must be one of \"N/A\", \"Determinable - Certainly True\", \"Determinable - True\", \"Determinable - Uncertain\", \"Determinable - False\", \"Determinable - Certainly False\". Ratings should be based on the quality of the new information introduced in a statement, and if anything in the statement is incorrect or misleading, the statement is considered incorrect.\n",
